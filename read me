Assignment 3:- Recursive Ray Tracing

To run the program follow the following steps

1. cd into the directory of the project
2. type make command
3. type ./trace_ray   scene_file    an_integer_for_simple/recursive_ray_tracing    here scene file is the name of the scene file for which you want to create the object.

For the argument for Single/Recursive Ray_Tracing  1 stands for Recursive Ray tracing with a depth of 3 and 0 or any other integer stands for single ray tracing 


For Example

For Single ray Tracing you can give the following command at the 3rd point

./trace_ray spheres.scene 0
	
For Recursive Ray Tracing you can give the following command at the 3rd point.

./trace_ray spheres.scene 1


For the recursive ray tracing I am using the following formula

final color = (1 - ks) * localPhongColor + ks * colorOfReflectedRay 


Points to note down

1. I have caclluted color at any pixel and stored it in its buffer posiion in the array unsignedchar buffer[HEIGHT][WIDTH][3].
   Then I am displaying the colors at the screen in vertical lines of pixels. Please wait for some time after running the code to get the full images.
3. All the functions written in the code have been properly commented before the definition with their arguments and functionality explained.
